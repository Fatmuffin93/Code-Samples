Death Game (Untitled at the moment) is a horror game that pays homage to classic horror games on the PS1
There is a hand enemy in the game that comes from the ground and will snatch the player if they are in range.
The green wire sphere triggers the hand, the red one triggers the attack, and the yellow one is the grab hitbox.
If grabbed you must mash the controller buttons to escape.

The Hands script inherits from the Enemy script which contains patrol states and attack states.
Hand movement is controlled by the animation.
