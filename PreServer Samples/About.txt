PreServer is a 3rd person platformer where you play as a digital squirrel in a simulator.
Two abilities the squirrel has are climbing, on specific surfaces, and dashing.
 - Climbing: The player is able to climb freely on certain tagged surfaces and transfer between climbs
	if the angle between normals is too big to look smooth with player control.
 - Lag Dash: The player is able to press a button to lag dash, holding the button slows down time and 
	allows players to visualize where they will end up on the dash. In this state, players are also able
	to adjust their rotation to a certain degree. The slow down is temporary, as time will slowly 
	return to normal.
The video attached shows off both abilities
Gizmos are left on to visualize the following:
 - Lag Dash:
	- Black Lines: The calculated path
	- Yellow Lines: Where the ground changed
	- Red Lines: The incremented under check
 - Climbing: (Player cannot go past the first two lines when climbing, past that is unsafe)
	- Pink under the player: Target rotation
	- Cyan Line: Target velocity
	- Pink at player origin: Velocity player moves when rotating on unsafe edges
