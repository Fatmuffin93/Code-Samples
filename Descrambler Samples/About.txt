Descrambler is a mobile word puzzle game. If the player is taking too long to find a word, a hint
will be generated for them.
The Hint script iterates through every tile on the board and recursively checks adjacent tiles
to construct a word. That word is then cross-referenced in the game's dictionary which is a
dictionary<int, List<string>>, the key being the string hash and the list being the words that
share that hash.
