Descrambler is a mobile word puzzle game. If the player is taking too long to find a word, a hint
will be generated for them.
The Hint script iterates through every tile on the board and recursively checks adjacent tiles
to construct a word. That word is then cross-referenced in the game's dictionary which is a
Dictionary<<string>, Dictionary<int, List<string>>> 
 - The first key being the first two letters the board picks up
	- This will eliminate cases such as 'bk' since no words start with those two letters
 - The second key is the string hash and the list being the words that share that hash
